            <div style="margin-bottom:2.5em;">
                <h2 style="color:#146eb4;border-bottom:2px solid #eaeaea;padding-bottom:6px;margin-top:2.2em;margin-bottom:0.7em;font-size:1.5em;">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#f90;font-size:1.1em;margin-right:8px;">Chapter 1:</span> The Birth of a Visionary (Pre-1994)
                </h2>
                <p style="line-height:1.7;margin:1em 0;">The early 1990s were a time of tectonic shifts in both politics and technology. The Cold War had just ended, giving way to a wave of globalization. Meanwhile, the internet, once a military and academic curiosity, was on the verge of becoming commercially viable. In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web, and by 1993, web browsers like Mosaic were making the internet accessible to the average user.</p>
                <p style="line-height:1.7;margin:1em 0;">Amid this digital dawn, a Wall Street executive named Jeff Bezos was working at D.E. Shaw, a prestigious hedge fund. Bezos, a Princeton graduate with a background in computer science and electrical engineering, came across a stat that changed everything: internet usage was growing at 2,300% per year.</p>
                <p style="line-height:1.7;margin:1em 0;">Bezos immediately recognized the commercial potential of the web. He drafted a list of 20 product categories that could be sold online. Books stood outâ€”they were standardized, easy to ship, and had a vast catalog. In 1994, Bezos left his lucrative job, packed his car, and drove to Seattle with his wife, MacKenzie, to start a company. He called it "Cadabra," but quickly changed it to "Amazon" after the world's largest river, symbolizing the company he hoped to build.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom:2.5em;">
                <h2 style="color:#146eb4;border-bottom:2px solid #eaeaea;padding-bottom:6px;margin-top:2.2em;margin-bottom:0.7em;font-size:1.5em;">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#f90;font-size:1.1em;margin-right:8px;">Chapter 2:</span> Garage Dreams (1994â€“1995)
                </h2>
                <p style="line-height:1.7;margin:1em 0;">Amazon was founded in July 1994 in Bezos' garage. The vision was clear: create an "everything store," starting with books. Seattle was chosen not only for its tech talent but also because it was close to Ingram, a major book distributor.</p>
                <p style="line-height:1.7;margin:1em 0;">Bezos and his small team built the website by hand. On July 16, 1995, Amazon.com went live. The first book ever sold? <em>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies</em> by Douglas Hofstadter. Within 30 days, they were selling books in all 50 states and 45 countries. The site was a hit. Customers were drawn to the convenience and the vast selection.</p>
                <p style="line-height:1.7;margin:1em 0;">From the start, Bezos instilled a customer-obsessed culture. He would bring an empty chair into meetings to represent the customer. It was his way of reminding employees who they were working for.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom:2.5em;">
                <h2 style="color:#146eb4;border-bottom:2px solid #eaeaea;padding-bottom:6px;margin-top:2.2em;margin-bottom:0.7em;font-size:1.5em;">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#f90;font-size:1.1em;margin-right:8px;">Chapter 3:</span> Get Big Fast (1996â€“1999)
                </h2>
                <p style="line-height:1.7;margin:1em 0;">As the internet gold rush gained momentum, Amazon raised millions in venture capital and went public in 1997 at $18 per share. Bezos was laser-focused on growth over profit. His famous mantra: "Get Big Fast."</p>
                <p style="line-height:1.7;margin:1em 0;">Amazon expanded into music, videos, toys, electronics, and more. It introduced features like customer reviews, personalized recommendations, and 1-Click ordering, which would become e-commerce standards.</p>
                <p style="line-height:1.7;margin:1em 0;">In 1999, Time Magazine named Jeff Bezos Person of the Year, recognizing Amazon as a leader in the internet revolution. But storm clouds were gathering.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom:2.5em;">
                <h2 style="color:#146eb4;border-bottom:2px solid #eaeaea;padding-bottom:6px;margin-top:2.2em;margin-bottom:0.7em;font-size:1.5em;">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#f90;font-size:1.1em;margin-right:8px;">Chapter 4:</span> The Crash That Didnâ€™t Kill (2000â€“2002)
                </h2>
                <p style="line-height:1.7;margin:1em 0;">The dot-com bubble burst in 2000. Tech stocks crashed, and many internet startups went bankrupt. Amazon's stock plummeted from over $100 to under $10. Analysts predicted its demise.</p>
                <p style="line-height:1.7;margin:1em 0;">But Bezos stayed the course. He made difficult decisions: layoffs, cost-cutting, and a renewed focus on operational efficiency. He introduced Amazon Marketplace in 2000, allowing third-party sellers to list products on the platformâ€”a decision that would prove genius.</p>
                <p style="line-height:1.7;margin:1em 0;">While others folded, Amazon survived. By 2002, it posted its first quarterly profit. The company had weathered the storm and emerged stronger.</p>
